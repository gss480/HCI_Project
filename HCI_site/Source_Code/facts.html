Seeing pictures of my baby and how much she has grown, gave me the motivation to be the best mommy to her as I could be. This included not smoking."</p>

                            <p>"Before my pregnancy, I smoked half a pack of cigarettes a day. During my pregnancy, I quit cold turkey. But because of the stress of taking care of a newborn, I always had the urge to smoke again. Now, I have used BabyBreathe for 3 months, and it helped me a lot. Whenever I feel the urge to start smoking, I press the MOTIVATE ME! button. Also, as a hard working single mom, BabyBreathe helps me keep track of how much money I have saved. This helps me to stay motivated to keep being healthy by not smoking. And using the money I have saved for stuff for my baby."</p>

Something snapped. I took a long hard look at the cigarette and lighter and threw them across the room."</p>
